# hangworld

Welcome to a little different version of hangman.

The classic game is back but this time the stakes are higher...
The world is heating up and expanding quickly... with every wrong guess the world grows in size!
Figure out the word before your guesses run out and save the planet. 

Design notes:
-The entire game is encompassed in an object.
-The game data is also a JS object. The keys of the object also serve as the "category"/"hint" provided on the screen.
-User input in the form of keyboard keypress - no mouse clicks.

Tech Used:
HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap

Thanks for dropping by!
